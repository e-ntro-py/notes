3.1
a permutation {0,1}^64 -> {0,1}^64 is a table of 64-bit strings of 2^64 entries
one such permutation takes 64 * 2^64 bits to describe (at least)
by using 80-bit keys, there are 2^80 such permutations in the idealized block cipher
2^80 * 64 * 2^64 = 2^150 bits in total

for all 2^56 keys:
a single processor takes 2^56 * 2^-26 = 2^30 seconds to do the exhaustive searching, or 34 years
assume the order is independent to the actual key, it 17 years in average
by using 2^14 processors, it takes 2^30 / 2^14 = 2^16 seconds, or about 18 hours to do the exhaustive search
in average the key will be found in 9 hours

3.6
in DES2, either half of the plaintext is affected by only one round function
given plaintext (L0, R0) and ciphertext (L2, R2)
by definition of DES, L1 = R0 and R1 = L2, all (Li, Ri) for i = 0 .. 2 are known
R1 = L0 xor F(k1, R0), R2 = L1 xor F(k2, R1), both the input and output of Fk1, Fk2 are known
therefore k1 and k2 can be exhaustively searched seperately, takes 2^48 * 2 = 2^49 encryptions
also in DES2, changing one half of the plaintext will only affect one half of the ciphertext
which only happens in an idealized cipher with probability 1/2^32

it's not reversible
assume the block size is 128 bits, then 0 <= n < 128, the encoding of n is a single byte
then the following padded text does not correspond to a unique plaintext:
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01
it can be sixteen 00 bytes or fifteen 00 bytes followed by a 01

4.2
fixed IV:   the same to ECB, doesn't have indistinguishable encryption
counter IV: not that different to fixed IV, the resulting scheme is not CPA-secure
random IV:  relies on a cryptographically secure random number generator, which may be inefficient
            otherwise this scheme can be proven CPA-secure given an idealized block cipher
nonce IV:   performance depends on the implementation of the nonce
            if it provides no randomness then the resulting scheme can not possibly be CPA-secure

4.3
K = C xor P = F(k, nonce||i)
C' = K' xor P'
K' = F(k, nonce||i')
if the block cipher is perfect, an adversary cannot possibly know K' given K
so even with knowledge of K, C, C' and P, the only thing an adversary can be sure is P xor P' != C xor C'

Another secret!

C1' = F(k, C0' xor P1')
C2 = F(k, C1 xor P2)
given C1' = C2, C0' xor P1' = C1 xor P2, P1' = C1 xor P2 xor C0'
given C1, P2 and C0', P1' can be computed
