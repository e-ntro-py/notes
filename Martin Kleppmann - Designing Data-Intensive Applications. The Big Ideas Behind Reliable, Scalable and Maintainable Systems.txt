p45, imperative vs. declarative javascript:
The culprit here is "no abstraction" instead of being imperative. 

p74, "n order to find the value for a key, we first check the most recent segment’s hash map; if
the key is not present we check the second-most-recent segment, and so on."
... or store the epoch number as part of the index.

Branching factor of a B-tree is variable in a range, in Rust BTreeMap the range is [5, 11].

p87, multi-column indexes
One possible solution to multi-dimensional queries in relational databases is data cube, which is
standardized in ISO SQL 2018.

p113, "if an attacker can get your application to decode an arbitrary byte
sequence, they can instantiate arbitrary classes, which in turn often allows them
to do terrible things such as remotely executing arbitrary code [6, 7]"
- [6]: CVE-2015-7501, Java, serializing / deserializing certain objects invokes methods through
    runtime reflection which can be exploited to run arbitrary code with forged payload
- [7]: CVE-2013-0156, Ruby, YAML.load occasionally evaluates serialized string which may include
    arbitrary code wrapped in `eval` function call
Both cases the vulnerability originated in lack of distinction between data and program in the
language and badly written serialization library, hence
> "For these reasons it’s generally a bad idea to use your language’s built-in encoding for

doesn't necessarily apply to something like Bincode. In the Ruby case it's not even built-in
encoding, YAML is developed independently and had seen wide adoption since its early days.
